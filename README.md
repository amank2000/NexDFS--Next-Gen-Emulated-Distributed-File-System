![EDFS Banner](link_to_banner_image)  <!-- Consider using a banner or logo for visual appeal -->

EDFS is a robust emulation of the renowned Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Our aim is to bring the power and functionality of HDFS to a compact, yet effective, emulation. Dive into a system that mirrors HDFS's architecture with a metadata server (Namenode), multiple data servers (Datanodes), and a user-friendly EDFS client.
